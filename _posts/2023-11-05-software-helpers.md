Dave Guarino has an interesting post where he writes about [software helpers](https://daveguarino.substack.com/p/friday-miscellany-software-helpers):

There's a lot of useful framing thoughts there, but as I started thinking about it, I thinking of more and more (not necessarily good or bad) software helpers out there, and wanted to gather some thoughts (will be updating as I think of more)
